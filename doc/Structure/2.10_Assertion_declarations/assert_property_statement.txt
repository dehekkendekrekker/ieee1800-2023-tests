====== assert_property_statement ======
Created Sunday 22 December 2025

IEEE 1800-2023 Section A.2.10, 16.14

assert_property_statement ::=
	**assert property** ( [[property spec]] ) [[6.3 Parallel and sequential blocks:action block|action block]]

===== property_spec permutations =====
[[property spec]] ::=
	[ clocking_event ] [ disable iff ( expression_or_dist ) ] [[property expr]]

==== Permutation 1: property_expr only ====
assert property ( property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 2: With clocking_event ====
assert property ( @(posedge clk) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 3: With disable iff ====
assert property ( disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 4: With clocking_event and disable iff ====
assert property ( @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block

===== action_block permutations =====
Same as [[6.10 Assertion statements:simple immediate assert statement|simple immediate assert statement]]:
* Pass statement only
* Else statement only
* Both pass and else
* Empty action
